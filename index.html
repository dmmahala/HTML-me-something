                    <p>At the time of this writing, I am 23 years old. My father has been in the Air Force for 25 going on 26 years. So, as you can imagine, I've spent most of my life moving from place to place every few years. This has afforded me an opportunity to see a great deal of places and experience many different aspects of American culture. Of all of the places I've lived, none have been more harsh, or beautiful, as Alaska. In this article, I will be detailing my experiences with the general lifestyles of Alaskans, the weather, the wilderness, and the wildlife.</p>
