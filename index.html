                        <p>At the time of this writing, I am 23 years old. My father has been in the Air Force for 25 going on 26 years. So, as you can imagine, I've spent most of my life moving from place to place every few years. This has afforded me an opportunity to see a great deal of places and experience many different aspects of American culture. Of all of the places I've lived, none have been more harsh, or beautiful, as Alaska. In this article, I will be detailing my experiences with the general lifestyles of Alaskans, the weather, the wilderness, and the wildlife.</p>

                        <p>Following my high school graduation in 2012, my family moved from Belleville, IL to Eielson Air Force Base, a small installation 25 miles southeast of Fairbanks, AK. It was quite the change. Eielson is a small installation, the average population was around the same as the average number of students attending my high school, Belleville East. As one would expect, such a small community nearly isolated in the Alaskan wilderness ends up being tight knit. Despite the fact that most airmen aren't stationed there for more than 3-4 years, a comaraderie forms among all those who are. Something about the living conditions of Alaska had a way of bringing people together. The old saying "misery loves company" didn't seem too far off the mark at first, but little did I realize that this place would come to grow on me.</p>

                        <p>When one thinks of severe Alaskan weather, they probably imagine the harsh and remorseless winter. While the winters there can certainly be cruel, what one does not expect is an equally brutal summer. With my luck, I had the joy of experiencing the most extreme of both that interior Alaksa has to offer. My first winter on Eielson was the coldest the region had seen in nearly 100 years, and my first summer was the hottest in almost 50. While the coldest day of that first winter was negative 62&deg; Fahrenheit, the hottest days of the the first summer were above 100&deg; Fahrenheit. In the winter, you have to time when you blink with your breathing or the moisture on your breath will freeze your eyelashes together. In the summer, wildfires sprout up all over the interior, and there are some days when the smoke is thick enough that it appears to be foggy.</p>

                        <h2 class="title">The Wilderness</h2>
                        <p>Alaska is home to the most pristine wilds I have ever seen. The forests are extensive and untamed, the air is crisp and fresh, and the sky is the bluest I've witnessed anywhere. In the winter, feet upon feet of snow smother the land, muffling every sound in every direction with a blanket of cold white dust. At night, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by snow, I have experienced what may be the closest to absolute silence one can find naturally in the world. It is indescribably peaceful, and at the same time just a touch unsettling. In the late spring, when the forests are at their fullest bloom, the air is so fresh that every breath seems to energize. Every season is filled with it's own reminders that Alaska is just as serene as it is dangerous.</p>

                        <p>If theres one thing I know of Alaskan wildlife, it's that it has little fear of mankind. Moose could ocasionally be seen wandering the base. There was a fox that liked to play with the guards at the front gate. The ravens are filled with a bravery that rivals the most aggressive french fry stealing seagull. Bears could be seen regularly on the sides of the highway to Fairbanks. Wolves could sometimes be heard in the distance howling at the moon late at night on base. If theres two things I know of Alaskan wildlife, the second is that most of it is delicious. One of the agents in my father's office liked to hunt, and shared his spoils with his coworkers. During my residence, I sampled reindeer, moose, bear, and the freshest Alsakan salmon possible.</p>

                        <p>While I only lived there for three years, I value my time there just as much as any other assignment my father had while I was growing up. My experiences there shaped much of the person I am today. Alaska has an almost exotic quality that makes for a great conversation starter, as well as connecting me to everyone else that has spent extended time there. While it's harshness would likely keep me from ever wanting to live there again, but I would love got visit again for a vacation or something of the like. My life in Alaska had it's ups and downs, but I wouldn't trade the experience of it for the world. </p>
